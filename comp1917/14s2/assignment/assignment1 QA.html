<!-- Add the FAQ from here -->

<p>
<li><b>Have there been any updates to the compiled programs in the <code>hw1.i86</code> and <code>hw1.mac</code>?</b>
<p>
Yes, these were updated at 2pm on Friday 15 August.
Please be sure to download the updated versions from 
<a href="./tools"><code>tools</code></a> directory.<br>
(the original <code>hw1.mac</code>
produced erroneous output for <code>s6.in</code>;
although no problems were noticed with <code>hw1.i86</code>
it would be safest to download the updated version anyway).

<p>
<li><b>Can you provide us with some sample input and output?</b>
<p>
There are a few sample inputs in the <a href="./sample">sample</a> directory.
You are encouraged to also make up some of your own.
For any given input, you can use the compiled program
in  the <a href="./tools">tools</a> directory to generate the target output.

<p>
<li><b>How do we run the compiled version, and how can we test our program?</b>
<p>
First, copy <code>hw1.i86</code> to your own directory.
You will then need to make it "executable" by typing:
<pre>
$ chmod a+x hw1.i86
</pre>
You can now test your program using input and output redirection,
combined with the <code>diff</code> command, as follows:
<pre>
$ ./hw1.i86 < s1.in > s1.tgt
$ gcc -Wall hw1.c
$ ./a.out < s1.in > s1.out
$ diff s1.out s1.tgt
$
</pre>
The <code>diff</code> command looks for the differences between two files.
If the two files are identical <code>diff</code> will return you to the
command prompt without producing any output. Otherwise, it will print
all the lines where the two files differ. Consider the following example:
<pre>
$ diff s1.out s1.tgt
2,3c2
&lt; 0-0 
&lt; 
---
&gt; 0-0
</pre>
This output means that lines 2 and 3 of <code>s1.out</code> are being
compared to line 2 of <code>s1.tgt</code> .
We see that there is an additional (blank) line in
<code>s1.out</code>, and that line 2 is also different in the two files.
Sometimes the two lines may look identical on the screen,
which suggests there may be a non-printable character or an
extra blank space at the end of the line. Before submitting,
you should make sure that the output of your program is
<b>exactly</b> the same as that of the supplied program.

<p>
<li><b>Can you give us some hints on how to get started?</b>
<p>
Your program should probably have a loop like this:
<pre>
  int ch;

  while(( ch = getchar()) != EOF ) { // be careful with parentheses!
     if( ch == 'S' ) {
         ...
     }
     else if( ch == 'A' ) {
         ...
     }
     else if( ch == 'B' ) {
         ...
     }
  }
</pre>
[See Course Notes, Chapter 8, slides 4-7 for further explanation.]<br>
You might like to use an array to store the number of games
won by Team A (or Team B) in each of the (up to 5) sets.
(Take care not to over-run the array!)

<p>
<li><b>Which team serves first?</b>
<p>
You should assume that Team A always serves
for the first game of the match.

<p>
<li><b>Can we use strings?</b>
<p>
Strings are not covered until later in the course
and are <b>not</b> recommended for this assignment.
However, if you insist on using them, you may find this
code useful:
<pre>
char *name[4] = { "Love", "15", "30", "40" };

for( i=0; i < 4; i++ ) {
  printf( "%s", name[i] );
}
</pre>

<p>
<li><b>When I submit, it says <code>"CPU time limit exceeded"</code>?</b>
<p>
Your program is going into an infinite loop.
You can probably fix it by adding code like this:
<pre>
if( ch == EOF) {
   exit(0);
}
</pre>
or changing your <code>scanf()</code> statement to this:
<pre>
if( scanf("%c",&ch) <= 0 ) {
   exit(0);
}
</pre>

<p>
<li><b>How can the score for a set be bigger than 6 ?</b>
<p>
To win a set, one team must score at least 6 games,
and at least two games more than the other team.
Scores of 5-7 or 7-5 are possible in the first four sets,
and higher scores are possible in the fifth set
(with games continuing to be played until one team
has a two-game lead).

<p>
<li><b>Can you provide sample input and output for the bonus challenge?</b>
<p>
There are a couple of sample tie-break inputs in the
<a href="./bonus">bonus</a> directory.

<p>
<li><b>During the tie-break, whose score should be listed first?</b>
<p>
The score for whichever team served the <b>first</b> point of the tie-break
should be listed first, <b>not</b> the team serving the current point.<br>
(Although confusing, this has become standard practice in televised coverage
because otherwise the audience would get even more confused with ordering
of the score swapping back and forth so frequently.)
