Tutorial Presentation
Given a point P=(x,y) and a triangle ABC with A=(x1,y1), B=(x2,y2) and C=(x3,y3), how can you test whether the point P is inside or outside the triangle? Find out one or two methods for doing this and explain them to the class. (Note: you should explain them using mathematical formulas, not actual C code.)
Week 3 Tutorial Questions

    Write a program that given three numbers first, second and third, finds out if the numbers are in strictly descending order (first > second > third). Is there an alternative way to write this program?

     1 #include <stdio.h>
     2
     3 int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
     4    int first, second, third;
     5    printf("Enter numbers: ");
     6    scanf("%d %d %d", &num);
     7
     8    return 0;
     9 }

    Modify previous program to check if three numbers are in ascending or descending order.
    Write a program that allows the user to enter at integer and then prints out that many stars, each on a new line.

    % ./stars
    Enter : 5


Presentation Topic for Week 4
Describe the ASCII coding system. (What does ASCII stand for?) Draw a schematic "map" of the ASCII Table on the board, showing (in both decimal and hexadecimal notation) where the following sets of characters lie:

    non-printable characters
    digits '0' to '9'
    uppercase letters 'A' to 'Z'
    lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'
    punctuation
