2. How would you free the allocated block after you've finished using it?

use free( pointer );



What are some of the implications of not freeing the memory?


memory leak?
run out of memory?

3. What is wrong with the following example

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    int size = 0;
    scanf("%d", &size);
    int *arr = createArray(size);

    return 0;
}
( incompatible return type ?)
int *createArray(int size){ // expect return type integer pointer
    int new_array[size]; // integer
    return new_array;
}
