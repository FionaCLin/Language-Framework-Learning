"Upon this basis I am going to show you how a bunch of bright young
folks did find a champion; a man with boys and girls of his own; a man
of so dominating and happy individuality that Youth is drawn to him as
is a fly to a sugar bowl. It is a story about a small town.
It is not a gossipy yarn; nor is it a dry, monotonous account, full of
such customary 'fill-ins' as 'romantic moonlight casting murky shadows
down a long, winding country road.' Nor will it say anything about
tinklings lulling distant folds; robins caroling at twilight, nor any
'warm glow of lamplight' from a cabin window. No.
It is an account of up-and-doing activity; a vivid portrayal of Youth
as it is today; and a practical discarding of that worn-out notion
that 'a child don't know anything.'
