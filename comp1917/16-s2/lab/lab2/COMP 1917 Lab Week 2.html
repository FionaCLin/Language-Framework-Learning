<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>
In this Lab, you will practice:
</p><ul>
<li> using the <code>gcc</code> system to compile C programs
</li><li> reading compiler error messages and repairing errors
</li><li> using a text editor to create small C programs
</li><li> writing C programs to do simple input, output and arithmetic
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this first Lab Exercise, the primary aim is for you to familiarise
yourself with the process of creating, compiling and executing simple
C programs.  We'll assume that you've already read Chapter 1
of the textbook. This exercise will simply ensure 
you are capable of writing a small program and getting it to run.
You should keep a copy of the textbook
handy, in case you get stuck and the instructions
here don't help you work things out.
</p>

<p>
Before the Lab Class finishes, you should demonstrate your program to
the tutor.  If the tutor says it's ok, then you should submit it using
the <code>give</code> command.  Once you've done this, you are free to leave the
Lab Class.  This means that if you want to prepare your Lab early and
show it to the tutor at the start of the class, you can have the rest
of the time off.
A successful completion will be noted by the tutor in the
class roll.  The exercise your tutor will be checking will be the one
involving <code>heron.c</code> .
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

Your task for this lab is to write a program  which inputs
the sidelengths <code>a, b</code> and c
of a triangle, and computes the area of the triangle
using Heron's formula:
<pre>   area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))
</pre>
where <code>s</code> is the "semi-perimeter"
<pre>   s = (a + b + c)/2.
</pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
You must first complete the first few steps of the
<a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1917/16s2/lab/wk01.html">Lab01</a> exercises,
which show you how to create a Unix account,
log in, and open a Web browser.

</p></li><li>
<p>
It's a good idea to create a new directory for each new Lab.
Create a directory called <code>lab2</code> by typing
</p><pre>    % mkdir lab2
</pre>
Change to this directory by typing
<pre>    % cd lab2
</pre>
Create heron.c by typing
<pre>    % gedit heron.c &amp;
</pre>
Copy the code template for a C file, into heron.c
<pre>    #include <stdio.h>

    int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {

    }
</stdio.h></pre>
Save your file and quit gedit.

You can check that the file is there by typing
<pre>    % ls
</pre>
(<code>ls</code> is short for "list").
<p>


</p></li><li>
You are now ready to start editing the file <code>heron.c</code>,
using your favourite editor. Note that the basic structure of
the program can be retained; you just need to change the
comments, variable names and formulas. You can comment out
or delete any parts of the program you think are not needed.
Keep in mind that all the programs you write in this course
should conform to the
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1917/15s2/style_guide.html">Computing 1 Style Guide</a>.
Some editors, like <code>vim</code>, make the job easier for you
by automatically indenting each line to the required number of spaces.
<p>

</p></li><li>
You can compile your program by typing
<pre>    % gcc -Wall -Werror -lm heron.c
</pre>

Note that the <code>gcc</code> command doesn't print anything
if the compilation is successful.
The <code>-Wall</code> option
tells the compiler to warn the user about all potential problems.
The <code>-lm</code> option reminds the linker to
include the math library.

After running <code>gcc</code>, you can check that it has produced
an executable by typing <code>ls -l</code> and looking for a
newly-created <code>a.out</code> file
(check the file time to see if it really is new).
<p>


Fix any errors identified by the compiler.
Here's what the input and output of your program might look like
when it is finished:
</p><blockquote>
<code>
% ./a.out<br>
Enter sidelengths of triangle:<br>
3 4 5<br>
Area = 6.00
</code>
</blockquote>

</li><li>
What happens when you type the following numbers into your program?
<pre>1 2 4
</pre>
Are there sets of numbers which cannot be the sidelengths of a triangle?
(Hint: do a Google search on "triangle inequality")<br>
Modify your program so that it will print an appropriate
error message in these circumstances.
<p>

</p></li><li>
When you are satisfied with your program, ask your tutor to
assess your work. Make sure you change the comments
(including the header comments) as well as
the executable statements in the program.
When your tutor has said that your program
is acceptable, you are to submit it electronically by typing
<pre>    % give cs1917 lab2 heron.c
</pre>

</li><li>
Bonus Challenge: (if time permits)<br>
Write a program <code>easter.c</code> which allows the user to
enter a year, then computes the date of Easter Sunday for that year, using
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1180480">Butcher's Formula</a>.
(For this exercise, you are allowed to cut-and-paste the formula from the Web site
and then fill in the C program around it; make sure every variable is declared, and every statement ends with a semicolon.)

When it is run, the input and output of your program should look like this:
<pre>    % ./easter
    Enter Year: 2015
    In 2015, Easter is April 5
    % ./easter
    Enter Year: 2016
    In 2016, Easter is March 27
</pre>

If you manage to complete it, submit the file <code>easter.c</code>
(along with <code>heron.c</code>) by typing
<pre>    % give cs1917 lab2 heron.c easter.c
</pre>
