<h2>Objectives</h2>

Scheduled Lab classes do not begin until Week 2.
However, we do have a set of simple warmup Lab exercises for
you to complete during Week 1.
If possible, you should complete them <strong>before</strong> your Week 2 Lab.


<h2>Overview</h2>

By the end of this lab you will have learned how to:
<ul>
<li>create your unix account
</li><li>log in to your unix account
</li><li>make your own web page
</li><li>read and send mail from your cse account
</li><li>use unix commands to create directories and files
</li><li>make a program
</li><li>print using the cse printers
</li></ul>

<h2>Task</h2>

</p><h2>Where to Go</h2>

A map of the CSE Labs can be found at
<a href="http://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/CSE_lab_map" target="_blank">http://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/CSE_lab_map</a>
Find an available machine in any of the labs and follow the Lab1 exercises
above. (If you do not have them with you, you can collect a printed handout
from outside the CSE Help Desk in Building J17, with instructions
for setting up your CSE account).

<h2>Choosing an Editor</h2>

The recommended text editor for this course is <code>emacs</code>.
It has the advantage of automatically "formatting" your C program
by indenting each line with the appropriate number of spaces.

Several other editors are available (<code>vi,kate,nano,nedit,gedit</code>).
Feel free to try them out and use whichever one you are most comfortable with.

<h2>Home Computing</h2>

Please click on the "HomeComputing" link under the "Administration" menu
on the course Web site, and try to set yourself up for home computing.
